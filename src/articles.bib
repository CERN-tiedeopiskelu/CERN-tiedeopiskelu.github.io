	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {The role that is assigned to elementary particle physics in high school education differs all over the world. Even within a single country like Germany there are major differences in the depth of discussion. To help teachers to address the fundamental concepts of elementary particles and their interactions and to reduce the subject didactically with respect to the given general conditions, Netzwerk Teilchenwelt has developed teaching material with an innovative didactic spiral approach that points out connections to common contents of physics curricula and is focused on the fundamental interactions of the Standard Model of particle physics and the charges that generate them. This concept is being presented and discussed during in-service trainings for teachers all over Germany. Since 2017, roughly 290 teachers have been trained in at least two-day courses and enabled to teach this approach.}

	journal = {Physics Education},
	abstract = {In the context of the recent re-start of CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the challenge presented by unidentified falling objects (UFOs), we seek to facilitate the introduction of high energy physics in the classroom. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of the LHC and its operation, highlighting existing education resources, and linking principal components of the LHC to topics in physics curricula.}

	title = {Let's have a coffee with the Standard Model of particle physics!},
	journal = {Physics Education},
	abstract = {The Standard Model of particle physics is one of the most successful theories in physics and describes the fundamental interactions between elementary particles. It is encoded in a compact description, the so-called ‘Lagrangian’, which even fits on t-shirts and coffee mugs. This mathematical formulation, however, is complex and only rarely makes it into the physics classroom. Therefore, to support high school teachers in their challenging endeavour of introducing particle physics in the classroom, we provide a qualitative explanation of the terms of the Lagrangian and discuss their interpretation based on associated Feynman diagrams.}
